        <h1>My Interests</h1>
        <h2 style="font-size: medium;">I really enjoy listening to music! Since I speak Spanish, I listen to both music in Spanish and music in English, sometimes even in French. Some of the kinds of music I listen to are:</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reggaeton</li>
            <li>Pop</li>
            <li>Hip-Hop</li>
            <li>R&B</li>
            <li>French Music</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Specifically, I love Ariana Grande and Bad Bunny. I have listened to Ariana Grande since the beginning of the pandemic and ever since, I have learned about her life and written essays about her.
            I also listen to her music on a daily basis. When I started listening to her music, in 2020, she had just released an album called Positions and I waited for her to release a new album which
            only happened this year when she released her best album yet(in my opinion), called Eternal Sunshine. Like a week after the release of the album, she released the music video of one of the songs
            called We Can't Be Friends which was so good and now I am waiting for the release of her new music video to her song The Boy is Mine which I suspect will be amazing!! I also really like Bad Bunny,
            especially since I went to his concert in March. I mostly listen to his music with my brother because he likes Bad Bunny a lot too. My favorite album from Bad Bunny is Un Verano Sin Ti and my favorite
            song from Bad Bunny is in that album and it is called Callaita. Since I mentioned I listen to french music, I want to explain a little more about why. I have been on duolingo for the past two years and I have
            a 550 day streak learning french. Also, last year I went to an overnight camp for two weeks where I learned a lot of french and that is also the place that got me into french music more.
