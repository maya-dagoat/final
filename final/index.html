        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <h2 style="font-size: medium;">My name is Maya, and this is my biography page.</h2>

        <p> In my free time, I enjoy dancing! I dance hip-hop with Annabelle. I have been dancing at a studio called Eastside Dance for two years, Annabelle joined my studio at the beginning of 8th grade, ever since
            then, we have been super best friends! We go to dance class Mondays and Fridays where we practice for our recital in June. We are really nervous but super excited for it! The theme of the recital is a dark version of Alice in Wonderland and
            we're dancing the part where Alice is fighting the Queen of Hearts.</p>
        <p> I have an amazing brother named Iker who lives in New York and visits me. When I grow up I want to be just like him! I also play fortnite with him from time to time. In fact, I might go to New York to visit him over the summer
            and I'm super excited!</p>
        <p>I also like being with my dog named Gem because she makes me feel happy :). Gem is a yorkshire terrier that my parents gifted me when I was 7 because
            I had been begging for a dog since I was little. She's the pickiest dog ever because she only likes meat and cheese but we still try to have her try new foods(it never works). We have a tradition
            where on each of her <span style="color: #E950BE;font-weight: bold;">birthdays</span>, we go to starbucks with her and get her a pup cup which she LOVES even though she's a little overweight... There are such few foods she likes I can even make a list!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Whipped Cream</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Meat</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even though she likes such few foods, she is overweight so the vet had to give us a few steps for how to get her to lose weight.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Give her treats only when she deserves them, not when she gives us puppy eyes</li>
            <li>Give her smaller pieces of treats</li>
            <li>Switch to healthier treats</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Since I am talking about myself, I thought it would be fun to show you some pictures of myself :)</p>
