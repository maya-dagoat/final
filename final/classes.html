            <h2>Class 1: Algebra 1</h2>
            <p>I have enjoyed this class this trimester because my teacher, Ms. Aguiar, is a very good teacher and I feel like I am learning a lot. I am also having a lot of fun.</p>

            <h2>Class 2: Scientific Thinking 3</h2>
            <p>I enjoy this class because it has a lot of hands on assignments and I think the subject we are learning right now, oceanography, is very interesting.</p>

            <h2>Class 3: Free Period</h2>
            <p>This trimester was the first time I have had free period and I have had a super fun time with Elisa because we listen to music, make slime, and make forts during our free period which is so much fun.</p>
